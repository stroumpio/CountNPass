# CountNPass

*This Android Studio project was part of the MSc dissertation of Ioannis Stroumpoulis at the University of Glasgow*

**Count ‘N’ Pass**: A novel authentication system for smartphones that uses a form of PIN mechanism with a secret key encryption, based on eyes-free 
interaction. Users enter and obfuscate their credentials through a vibrotactile interface that includes a blank screen with no visual feedback,
achieving resistance to shoulder surfing attacks.

Two experiments were conducted:
1. A usability experiment 
2. A security experiment

The current form of the project refers to the **usability experiment**
